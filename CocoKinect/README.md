CocoKinect is a Cocoa application for controlling RAMDanceToolkit using a Kinect V1 camera or a Kinect camera v1 recording

It is built using Cinder 0.8.5, libc++ library and c++11 dialect and CCGL Cocoa wrapper for Cinder. It assumes that libboost_thread.a has been built with the above.

This project uses standard osc Cinder block and slightly modified BlockOpenNI (included)
