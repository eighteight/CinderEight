Block OpenNI
------------
A C++ wrapper for OpenNI

2011-06-20:
This block is going through heavy remake and so old code/methods are mixed with new methods for the moment.
I will be changing the way things are handled at the moment when i'm finished. All for better support on multiple devices.





Basic description
-----------------

Support for several generators as Image, IR, Depth and User.
Skeleton tracking is also supported.




How to use
----------

You need to install the sensor drivers, OpenNI and NITE.
Note! PrimeSense drivers do not work with the Kinect. 


So here's a step-by-step installationg guide:
(The links you'll find here are the latest unstable at the time of writing)
OpenNI 1.3.2.3
Nite 1.4.1.2
SensorKinect 5.0.3.4
